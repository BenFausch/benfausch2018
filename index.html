							<b>
								What kind of developer am I?
							</b>
<br>I am a lean, mean coder.
<br>I work fast to get a project up, and am not afraid of scrapping an entire codebase if the project takes a new direction.
<br>I learn fast to get building.
<br>I won't take a 12 week bootcamp or even a 12 step class to learn something.
<br>I will read the boring spec sheet and developer docs, and will break it until it works.
<br>I am not afraid to get out of a library and write something in pure JS.
<br>I am not afraid of PHP and know its merit in building the web despite flash-in-the-pan libraries that have taken over.
<br>I will script out my entire job if it means that I can work on the parts of the project that matter.
<br><b>
<br>What makes me different from other developers?
</b>
<br>I don't just speak in code. I speak English.
<br>My background is in music and technology. I worked in the music industry for around a decade as a recording engineer, designer, teacher, and performer, so communicating with a diverse group of people has always been essential.
<br>
							Part of my services to various labels and studios included branding, graphic design, and marketing. That being said, I feeI as comfortable designing a logo as I do writing a search engine.
							<br>
						In fact, I have a Master's degree from The New School in interaction and game design and have taught design and UX principles at Parsons School of Design.</span>
